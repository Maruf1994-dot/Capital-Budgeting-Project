ðŸš€ Project: Capital Budgeting Analysis for Nike Company Storage Expansion

Overview:
Completed a comprehensive capital budgeting analysis to evaluate the feasibility of opening two new storage facilities for Nike Company. Employed various financial metrics including Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period to assess the potential profitability and viability of each project.

Approach:

Conducted thorough market research to understand demand and growth prospects in the storage industry.
Gathered data on initial investment costs, operating expenses, and projected cash flows for each project.
Utilized discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to calculate NPV, considering Nike's cost of capital and future cash inflows.
Evaluated risk and uncertainty by conducting sensitivity analysis on key assumptions.
Compared and contrasted the financial metrics to recommend the most financially sound investment opportunity.

Key Findings:

Project 1:
NPV: $108,206
IRR: 10%
Payback Period: 3.91 years

Project 2:
NPV: $23,834
IRR: 11%
Payback Period: 3.76 years

Considering these factors, here's a breakdown:

Project 1 has a significantly higher NPV, indicating greater profitability over the project's lifetime.

Project 2 has a slightly higher IRR, suggesting potentially higher returns relative to the initial investment.

Both projects have relatively similar payback periods, but project 2's is slightly shorter.

Given these points, it appears that Project 1 is the better choice based on the NPV, indicating higher profitability over the project's lifetime. However, if the managers prioritize a quicker return on investment, they may opt for Project 2 due to its slightly higher IRR and shorter payback period. 

Lessons Learned:

Enhanced proficiency in financial modeling and capital budgeting techniques.
Developed a deeper understanding of risk assessment and investment decision-making processes.
Strengthened ability to communicate complex financial concepts and recommendations to stakeholders.
